Mitch McDermott,April 2010, But seriously tell all your friends! The owner has the best style. NO INDOOR PLUMBING!! I want my money back. The owner wouldn't let me bring my pet bear. The view form the back porch was to die for. I wish I could have stayed longer. This place is awesome! My partner and I always wanted to visit. Why didn't I find this place sooner? BE WARNED! I do not regret anything! The place smelled very bad! It was quite a drive from the airport. But the owner was cool.,https://beartnt-profile-photos.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beartnt+profile+photos/pexels-photo-4886801.jpeg,100
Zach McCain,February 2013, I want my money back. It was quite a drive from the airport. The owner has the best style. We had so much fun! The owner wouldn't let me bring my pet bear. The view form the back porch was to die for. And I would do it again! I came here for my honemoon. I wish I could have stayed longer. The town was very cute. Why didn't I find this place sooner? The place smelled very bad! Very much worth it. I do not regret anything!,https://beartnt-profile-photos.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beartnt+profile+photos/pexels-photo-1310522.jpeg,100
Henry Fradley,November 2019, I want my money back. The place smelled very bad! It was quite a drive from the airport. This place is awesome! NO INDOOR PLUMBING!! The town was very cute. The owner has the best style. But seriously tell all your friends! I wish I could have stayed longer. And I would do it again! The view form the back porch was to die for. BEST TRIP EVER! We had so much fun! The owner wouldn't let me bring my pet bear. You can tell the owner really likes bears. BE WARNED! I came here for my honemoon. The torcher chamber was a bit too much. Very much worth it. But the owner was cool.,https://beartnt-profile-photos.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beartnt+profile+photos/pexels-photo-415829.jpeg,100
